# curread

### An android app to help blind people read currency notes.
---------------

Features currently supported:

- [x] Opening the camera, clicking a photo, and saving it in memory.

TODOs :

- [ ] Build a proper landing page and a user- interface
- [ ] Use openCV or any other pre-built API to determine what kind of currency it is.
      * Match the face on the currency note with already stored faces, like that of Mahatma Gandhi.
      * Look for texts on the currency, and if you find "Reserve Bank of India", or "India" or any other country's name, infer what kind of currency it is.
- [ ] Determine what the value of currency is.
      * Look for digits on the currency, and infer its value.
- [ ] Give a voice message to the user, delivering what the value and type of currency is.

This project is under heavy development, hence totally open to contributions and suggestions.
